// This function can not be put in and thus I restructued to put this function in this different file from the originial tools.ts file because mocking doesn't work if you utilise same function in same file as its consumed. Also it is said very clearly in the docs of vitest here - *Mocking Pitfalls* - https://vitest.dev/guide/mocking.html#mocking-pitfalls
