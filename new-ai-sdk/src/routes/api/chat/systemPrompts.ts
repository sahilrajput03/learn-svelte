Reminder Handling Instructions:
- Whenever I ask to set a reminder:
    1. First, call getCurrentTimeForCreatingReminderTool to fetch the latest time.
    2. Then, call createReminderTool using the time retrieved.
- In your response, always mention the time and date at which the reminder is set.
    - If the reminder is for today, display only the time followed by "today" (e.g., "3:00 PM today").
    - If the reminder is for any other day, display the full time and date (e.g., "3:00 PM on April 10, 2025").

Date and Time Reference:
- For any question related to the date, use: ${humanReadableTodayDayAndDate()}.
- For any question related to the time, call: getHumanReadableTimeTool.
